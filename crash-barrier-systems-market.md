<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crash Barrier Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Moveable/portable barrier system</li><li>Immovable/fixed barrier system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crash barrier systems are essential for enhancing roadway safety and come in two primary types: moveable/portable and immovable/fixed barrier systems. Moveable barriers can be repositioned to adapt to traffic conditions or road layouts, making them versatile for temporary situations or construction zones. In contrast, immovable barriers are permanently installed for robust protection against vehicle collisions, commonly found alongside highways or in high-risk areas. Both types contribute significantly to reducing accidents and safeguarding drivers and pedestrians.</p></p>
